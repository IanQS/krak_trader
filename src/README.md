# Purpose

1) I like to get my hands dirty making and learning things on my own

2) Typing the commands into Kraken and monitoring stuff is glorified babysitting. I'd like to move away from all of that and focus on the more technical / interesting side of things 

# Disclaimer

This is a followup to [PyFin](https://github.com/IanQS/pyFin) which I've since archived because it is too similar to my day to day job.

The approach here is more of forecasting and day trading whereas the other one was about using Reinforcement Learning to make an automated trader
