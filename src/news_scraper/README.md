news_scraper

TODO:
 - Learn markdown and properly format this file (lol)
 - Research sites for crypto news articles/blurbs/predictions
   - Determine which of these have APIs, and which need scraping
 - Create a semantic regressor to rate an article on a [-1,1] continuum of good/bad news for a currency
 - NER: which currency/ies are mentioned in the article
 - Evaluate predictions made in previous articles (did prices actually rise/fall)
   - use these to rate article authors by dependability
 - build corpora of article rawtexts, and author scores
